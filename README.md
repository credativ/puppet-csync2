##Overview

This is a puppet module to manage csync2. Works on puppet >= 2.7 and Debian systems.

##Module description

csync2 is a cluster synchronization tool and this module provides a way
to manage it with puppet, using pre-shared keys and a custom configuration
template.

## Setup

### What csync2 effects

* csync2 package
* csync2 main configuration file (/etc/csync2.cfg)
* a csync2 key in /etc/csync2.key

### Beginning with csync2

To get started with csync2, you need:

- a configuration template or file for csync2, since the module does not
  provide a default
- a key for csync2 (for example created with csync2 -k)

The module supports a generic options hash via the options argument,
which can be used to pass parameters to your template.

```puppet
class { '::csync2':
  config_template   => 'modules/site/csync2.cfg.erb',
  key               => 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
  options           => $options_hash
}
```

##Usage

You can include the classes you need and configure it via the parameters it
supports. Please see the class docs for supported parameters and their
meaning.

### Classes

Other systems may be supported but cannot be guaranted.
